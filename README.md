# wowSales

## About
A Python project made to analyze sales and purchases made on MMORPG World of Warcraft in the year of 2019. The input data is two `.csv` files generated by WoW addon [TradeSkillMaster](https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/)

This is my first Python code, written as i studied the language. The results from my year of sales and purchases are available, in portuguese, on [my portfolio](https://hugobrancowb.github.io/).

## Running
Put the `.csv` files exported by [TradeSkillMaster](https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/) addon inside `data` folder and follow the instructions.

### Options
```
$ python wowsales.py

1. Update sales data.
2. Plot data.
3. Print sales record.
4. Delete existing data.
5. Income report for each month.

0. Exit.
```
